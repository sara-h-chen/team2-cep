### Introduction
- Start by introducing your team, and then your clients
- What did you agree to do for them?
- **What did you deliver?** Things that your client needed help with. What did you build? What were the constraints and limitations did you face? What did you and your client ultimately agree on?
- How did you know your project was successful? How do you know it made an impact? What are the practical standards that you follow? You may have to follow standards? What were the standards you did? E.g. your browser can handle any rendering errors, etc.

10 minutes to run through the entire presentation; no restrictions.

Submit the slides, so that you can present immediately. Finish just on time, etc. 9 ~ 9.5 minutes; 3 mins for Q and A. You do not submit the system, you just demo the system.

Ensure that your live demo is working before the presentation.

__Be prepared for questions, especially for things that are not described clearly in the presentation__
